	<h1>Facundo Lema</h1><hr>
	<p> I am a 20-year-old mathematics and physics student at
		<a href="https://www.uba.ar/#/">University of Buenos Aires</a>.
		I am interested in computer graphics, topology, geometry and CGI. I love computers, numbers and science.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		On my last year of high school (2019), I started planning a trip across Europe,
		a journey that began at the very beginning of 2020. During the trip, I decided to move to Sweden for a year to learn the language. 
		I have always found Scandinavia a very interesting place, and I regard Sweden as one of the most beautiful countries in Europe.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		After a short period living in Sweden, the COVID&#x2011;19 outbreak reached the country and I suddenly had lots of time to spend indoors. 
		I sought to improve myself in different aspects. On one hand, I made significant improvements in Swedish skills, 
		and on the other, I started learning more about things I had always found interesting but never had the time to study about: 
		Design, CGI and Computer Science stood out.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I started attending <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science</a> 
		lectures through <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">EdX</a>, 
		learning a ton of new things every class and using that acquired knowledge later in every problem set. Simultaneously, 
		I learned how to use <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a>, an awesome free, open&#x2011;source 3D software, 
		along with many other apps from <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Cloud</a>, 
		such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro and After Effects. I also bought an iPad and started doing 
		illustrations on Procreate.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All that interaction with design software, combined with everything I was learning about programming and the inner works 
		of a computer forced me to look into the mathematics and physics behind them. I began asking questions: 
		<i>How accurate are Blender's physics simulations? How can a coumputer accurately represent 3D space? How does 3D rendering work? 
			Maths behind ray&#x2011;tracing? Millions of calculations per second for each frame in a game?!</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All those questions, and their answers, made me want to study mathematics and physics. After a year in Sweden, 
		I returned to Argentina and started studying physics at University of Buenos Aires. I attended 
		<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/">Harvard's CS50's Understanding Technology</a> 
		through its <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology">EdX course</a>. I also started building computers, 
		first one for myself, then for some family members, friends and at the end I even sold some. Additionally, I built a few bespoke 
		mining rigs for some clients.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To come to the point, I love computers (both hardware and software), programming, mathematics, physics, design, art, 
		computer graphics, algorithms and more, and I wish to keep learning, as much as possible, in every possible occasion.
	</p>
